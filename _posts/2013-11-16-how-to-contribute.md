# Origins of this site

This is a fork of the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/minimal-mistakes/).

# How to update it

If you're a member of our github organization, you can clone and edit the site on our [github page](https://github.com/nashville-women-programmers/nashville-women-programmers.github.com).  If you aren't a member, you can fork the project from there and then edit it.

1. Make sure you have jekyll installed (`gem install jekyll`).
2. Fork this site from our [github page](https://github.com/nashville-women-programmers/nashville-women-programmers.github.com), then clone yoru fork of the site.
3. Once you've downloaded the project, swap out the comments on lines 5 and 6 of `_config.yml`.
4. Then, run `jekyll serve --watch` in the project directory.
5. The site will now be visible locally at [localhost:4000](localhost:4000).
6. Make your edits and then commit to github (making sure not to commit your changes to lines 5 and 6 of `config.yml`).
7. Make a pull request on github.com, and we'll integrate your changes.
