We are a Nashville code user group dedicated to furthering the careers of local women in software development. Gatherings are held second and fourth Monday of every month from 5:30 pm to 8pm at Nashville Software School. The group is open to all ages, experience levels, and backgrounds. Although our focus is on women, any person is welcome who can abide by our Code of Conduct. Our meetings are focused on coding, learning, networking, and having fun with programming.

# Who
This group is hosted by women programmers with the goal to build a welcoming environment to learn and to grow diversity in the programming field. People of all backgrounds and skill levels are welcome to attend. We've had people as young as 7 who hack on Minecraft and others 60+ who are new to coding. All we ask is that you follow the Hacker School Social Rules so we can maintain an environment of encouragement, openness, support, and all who attend can feel comfortable, welcome, and free to ask questions and grow.

# When
5:30pm - 8pm. Every 2nd and 4th Monday. For the most updated meeting information, check this Meetup Group.

# Where
Eventbrite Nashville
209 10th Ave S
Nashville, TN 37203

#Format
We often have speakers/presentations. We will communicate the topic and skill-level ahead of time.

Unless a presentation is noted, the format for meetings is a come-and-go, casual co-working time. Bring whatever coding project or tutorial you are working on, some coding-related reading material, coding questions, etc. Or just hang out and meet other programmers. Feel free to bring headphones and work alone in-the-zone, or get social and work on problems together. If you are new to coding, bring a laptop/tablet/smart phone and we can help get you setup with resources to learn.

#How Much
Free to attend. Free coffee.  Feel free to bring dinner with you to eat before the meeting formally starts.  NSS has a breakroom with fridge/microwave available.
