We are a Nashville code user group dedicated to furthering the careers of local women in software development. Gatherings are held first and third Saturday of every month from 10am to 2pm at Eliza Brock Software. The group is open to all ages, experience levels, and backgrounds. Although our focus is on women, any person is welcome who can abide by our Code of Conduct. Our meetings are focused on coding, learning, networking, and having fun with programming.

# Who
This group is hosted by women programmers with the goal to build a welcoming environment to learn and to grow diversity in the programming field. People of all backgrounds and skill levels are welcome to attend. We've had people as young as 7 who hack on Minecraft and others 60+ who are new to coding. All we ask is that you follow the Hacker School Social Rules so we can maintain an environment of encouragement, openness, support, and all who attend can feel comfortable, welcome, and free to ask questions and grow.

# When
10am - 2pm. Every 1st and 3rd Saturday. For the most updated meeting information, check this Meetup Group.

# Where
Eliza Brock Software
2508 Franklin Pike
Suite 200
Nashville, TN 37204

Note: Eliza Brock Software shares a parking lot with Black Bird Tattoo and additional parking is available in the back. Eliza's office entrance is on the north side of the building and has a red door.

#Format
Occasionally we will have speakers/presentations. We will communicate the topic and skill-level ahead of time.

Unless a presentation is noted, the format for meetings is a come-and-go, casual co-working time. Bring whatever coding project or tutorial you are working on, some coding-related reading material, coding questions, etc. Or just hang out and meet other programmers. Feel free to bring headphones and work alone in-the-zone, or get social and work on problems together. If you are new to coding, bring a laptop/tablet/smart phone and we can help get you setup with resources to learn.

#How Much
Free to attend. Free coffee. Bring some cash if you would like to order in food for lunch. Or Eliza also has a kitchen at the office with a fridge and microwave, if you would like to bring a packed lunch.
